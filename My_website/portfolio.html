<p>1.This is a recent scratch project that ive worked on with my partner Andrew Martinez. the name of our game is called <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173451594/"> Dungeon Master</a>.</p>
<p>2.one of our challenges that we had while designing our game was programing a the handle ground code so it doesnt fall through the ground</p>
<p>3.we resolved it by doing research on how to create the code</p>
<p>4.on this scratch project I how learned how to program different sprites and backgorunds in order to interact with each other.</p>

<p>For this assignment, I work with Samuel Salzar on developing a presentation on a malware virus. There were no challenges really since it was just research and a presentation. One thing i did learn was how the virus attacks and thats through an infected email. when the recipient</p>

<p>For this assignment i worked with Tyler Hit on altering an image by adding a static background behind the jerry picture. One of our challenges while doing this project was chaging the opacity of the jerry image so the static picture would be able to show right through the jerry picture. After trial and error we were able to fix our code and accomplish our goal.</p>

<hr>Big Data on Amazon<hr>

<img src="images/Capture.PNG" height=180>
<p>For this assignment i worked solo since it was a presentation. My presentation was about Amazon and how it relates to big data. It relates to big data because of how Amazon is able to store data from your search history and is able to offer suggestions as to what you may like based on it.</p>

<hr>Capital City Quiz<hr>

<img src="images/Capture from replit.PNG" height=180>
<p>on this project i dont exactly remember who i worked with but this is a project my partner and I worked on replit using python. This project is a capital city quiz made to test the knowledge of others on the states and capitals. One of our main difficulties while working on this was developing a random generator so everytime the quiz starts it wouldnt be in the same order. We resolved our issue by calling my Aunt because she is a software engineer and she helped us develop a code while using the letter I as main variable in the code.</p>

<p>for this project I worked with Jonathan Vy on making an eductional app for those within the age groups of 2-4 years. our app works as a multiple choice test and teaches the youth different animal sounds and what the animals are. We did not face any difficulties while making this project although it was quite tidious becasue we had to keep going back and forth on the pages while coding. </p>
