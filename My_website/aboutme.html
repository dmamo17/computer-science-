<h1>This is my About Me Page!</h1>
<pre>So my is name is Deo Mamo. I am a hybrid of Ethiopian and Indian descent. 
I attend Don Lugo Highschool and I am part of the LEAD academy which is an 
engineering program that prepares us for the future. Some of my hobbies include
basketball, soccer, videogames and weight lifting. For my future I plan on 
attending a community college and then transfer to a 4 year. I have not decided yet because I am still 
exploring various fields like engineering and medical field. If nothing goes as 
as planned for whatever hypothetical reason, i will become a personal trainer. </pre>
